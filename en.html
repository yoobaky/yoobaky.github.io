                <p>Inventions (models, patents, concepts, simple ideas and decisions, etc…) are abounding. The expectations of the market and the society are multiple, urgent and critical (health, social balance, living environment, education, etc.). To innovate is to integrate the contemporary paradigms, the complexity of ecosystems, and especially overstep the interplay of current actors. </p>
                <p>Innovation is to test, to put forward, to achieve further and faster, by taking into account the stakeholders’ expectations and at the same time thinking out of the box.</p>
                <p>Yoobaky believes in open innovation, in disruptive business models, in links between stakeholders who do not always understand one another, to foster structural changes of society.</p>
                <p>We believe in accelerated execution capabilities, which enable testing both the final users as well as the key stakeholders influencing the market access.</p>
